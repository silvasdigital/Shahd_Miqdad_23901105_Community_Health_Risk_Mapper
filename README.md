# Community Health Risk Mapper

This project is an educational web application designed to demonstrate how geographic data and health metrics can be combined to visualize community health risks. It's a non-functional, educational tool that uses pre-set, simulated data.

The application loads an interactive map using **Leaflet.js** and places colored risk overlays on different communities. A **Chart.js** bar chart provides a visual breakdown of the risk factors for the selected area.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Interactive Map:** Uses Leaflet.js to display a fully interactive map.
- **Risk Overlays:** Dynamically draws colored circles on the map to represent high, medium, or low-risk zones.
- **Data Visualization:** A horizontal bar chart (using Chart.js) displays the underlying health metrics for each community (e.g., Air Quality, Park Access).
- **Pre-set Scenarios:** Includes 3 hard-coded community scenarios that users can load by clicking buttons.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is mobile-friendly and centers content correctly on all screen sizes.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and bundled with Webpack.
